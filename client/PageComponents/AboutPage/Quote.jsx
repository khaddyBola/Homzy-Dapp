              People buy their first home often before the age of 35. At least 20 percent of them sell it in a few years and buy a larger or better quality home. Another part of the population is constantly faced with the need to rent housing. This is not to mention the fact that each of us travels and needs temporary accommodation in another country or city.

             All of these are resources for your transactions. Implement a loyalty program right in this Homyz that will accompany customers throughout their lives.
